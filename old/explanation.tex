\section{Introduction}
The transductions are automorphisms on the binary tree - the neighbors of the infinite binary tree are either prefix.

Why is the collection of transductions a semigroup? Indentity is clear. Composition - why is the composition of transductions a transduction? The two transducers could have different state sets. Or does this follow from closure properties?
